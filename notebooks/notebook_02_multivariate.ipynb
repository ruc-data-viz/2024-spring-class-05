    "There are many ways for us to work with and visualize multivariate data, but it is highly dependent on the data. Data that consists of clusters of data can be visualized using methods like parallel coordinate/Andrews Curves; data that consists of categorical data may be representable with a radar plot; and sometimes the data just needs to be manipulated in ways to reduce what an analyst is looking at. We will soon be looking in more detail on how to cluster and group data, especially when working with data that is not directly categorical."
